<h1>Agile Copter</h1>

<h2>Presentation</h2>

<p>This page quickly presents a unique multicopter UAV configuration imagined and developped by <a href="http://crubier.net">Vincent Lecrubier</a> between 2006 and 2013.</p>

<p>The original idea of the Agile copter is to have a UAV with 6 spatial degrees of freedom (3 translations and 3 rotations). While most UAVs allow to directly control 3 rotational degrees of freedom (pitch, yaw and roll), no UAV allows to directly control more than 1 translational degree of freedom: fixed wing allow to control longitudinal movement, and rotorcraft allow to control vertical movement. Some VTOL configurations allow to control 2 translational degreees of freedom: longitudinal and vertical, but not lateral movement is directly controllable independently of the attitude. The Agile copter has 6 degrees of freedom, and it can have any attitude  while also having a non-corelated translation motion.</p>

<p>A study of a tri-rotor agile copter configuration was performed at <a href="http://www.isae.fr/en">ISAE</a> in 2007 by <a href="http://crubier.net">Vincent Lecrubier</a> and Yann Ameho. From there, continued the developpement of the Agile copter as a side project. Developpment included the design of a tilt mechanism, simulations and control law synthesis using simulink, and integration. Finally, a four rotor version of the agile copter took its first flight in late 2012.</p>

<p>Explanation of the principles of the agile copter were provided by Vincent Lecrubier on the Open pilot forums in 2011-2012. Unfortunately, the forums are now down. 3D visuals clearly showing a UAV with independently tilted rotors were created by Vincent Lecrubier in early 2007 and uploaded to wikipedia (<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Micro-drone&oldid=14740425">Link to wikipedia archive from 2007</a>)</p>

<p>The principle of the agile copter has since been patented by an unrelated team in 2013 (<a href="https://www.google.fr/patents/US20130105635?dq=uav+configuration+vtol&hl=fr&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwij7bHunr7LAhWCmBoKHSA-DRIQ6AEILjAC">Google patent</a>).</p>

<h2>Videos</h2>

First flight in late 2012. These flights highlighted the need for full metal gear servos, due to high constraints excerted on the tilt mechanism.

First FPV flights, including a crash and some light tilt rotor action.
